This version can run following things parallelly:
1. UI => Under "UI_thread" control, can read keyboard and interaction with button and keyboard
2. main => Under other "threads" control.

Feature :
1. "UI" will not block the keyboard.
2. After pressing(not rotate) the "knob", UI_thread update the label of adjustment_mode
3. This version uses app form to launch the whole process including UI and exe.

To-do:
1. Combine to Cali.c
	1.1 GTK_UI one label shows "Waiting for pollingâ€œ => (create threads)canbus & modbus polling => (join thread)canbus & modbus => use a signal to disable the label and showup all widgets
2. Get the calibration type and show it on the screen (perhaps, we can put some fake data to frame.data[2..7])
3. Get the communication interface and show it on the screen (Read "communication_found")
4. 


"compile.sh" will compile "Cali.c" and all the resources it needed.
After that, it will generate a executable file named "b".
